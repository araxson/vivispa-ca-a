## SEO Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Verification Code Implementation**: Replace placeholder verification codes in metadata.ts with actual verification codes from Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, etc.

2. **Schema Markup Testing**: Run structured data through Google's Rich Results Test to ensure all schemas are valid and eligible for rich snippets.

3. **Automated SEO Audits**: Implement regular SEO audits using tools like Lighthouse or an SEO monitoring service to track performance over time.

4. **Mobile SEO Optimization**: Ensure perfect mobile experience with specific testing on popular mobile devices.

5. **Local SEO Enhancement**: Consider adding more location-specific schema and content targeting Calgary neighborhoods.

6. **Internal Linking Strategy**: Develop a more robust internal linking strategy to improve crawlability and page authority distribution.

7. **Content Strategy**: Develop a comprehensive content strategy for blog posts to target long-tail keywords and improve domain authority.

8. **Core Web Vitals Monitoring**: Implement real user monitoring of Core Web Vitals metrics to ensure continued optimization.

## General Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Testing Implementation**: Consider adding comprehensive testing using tools like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress for E2E testing.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment.

3. **Performance Budget**: Define a performance budget and ensure it's enforced during the build process.

4. **Internationalization**: Consider adding i18n support if the application needs to support multiple languages.

5. **State Management**: Evaluate if the current state management approach is sufficient or if you need a more robust solution for complex state.

6. **Accessibility Audit**: Conduct a thorough accessibility audit using tools like axe or lighthouse.

7. **Documentation**: Improve documentation for components, API endpoints, and codebase structure to help future developers.
