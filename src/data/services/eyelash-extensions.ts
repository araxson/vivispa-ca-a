  scientificInfo: "Eyelash extensions are semi-permanent synthetic fibers manufactured from polyester or silk-like materials, individually bonded to natural eyelashes using medical-grade cyanoacrylate adhesive. The extensions typically range from 0.03mm to 0.25mm in diameter and 6mm to 18mm in length, with various curl patterns designed to mimic natural lash configurations. Natural eyelashes follow a growth cycle consisting of anagen, catagen, and telogen phases, with extensions applied only to lashes in the active growth phase to maximize retention and minimize stress on the follicle.",

  overview: "Eyelash extensions have become one of the most popular semi-permanent beauty treatments, offering a solution for enhanced eye definition without daily makeup application. The technique originated in Asia and has evolved significantly with improvements in adhesive technology, fiber materials, and application methods. Modern eyelash extension procedures provide natural-looking results that complement individual eye shapes and personal style preferences while maintaining the health of natural lashes.",

  benefits: [
    "Eliminates daily mascara application and makeup removal routines",
    "Creates immediate enhancement of eye appearance and facial definition",
    "Provides customizable results from natural enhancement to dramatic transformation",
    "Offers waterproof and smudge-proof solution ideal for active lifestyles",
    "Maintains natural lash movement and comfortable weightless feel",
    "Saves significant time in daily beauty routines while ensuring consistent appearance",
    "Provides various styling options including classic, volume, and hybrid techniques",
    "Enhances confidence and self-esteem through improved eye definition"
  ],
  
  procedure: "The eyelash extension application process begins with a comprehensive consultation to assess natural lash health and determine appropriate extension specifications. The client's eyes are thoroughly cleansed to remove makeup, oils, and debris that could interfere with adhesive bonding. Protective gel patches are carefully applied to isolate lower lashes and protect the under-eye area. Using precision tools and magnification, individual extensions are systematically applied to natural lashes using medical-grade adhesive. The process concludes with gentle air circulation to ensure complete adhesive curing and final styling of the extensions.",
  
  indications: "Eyelash extensions are indicated for individuals seeking enhanced eye definition, those with sparse or short natural lashes, people with active lifestyles requiring waterproof eye makeup solutions, individuals allergic to traditional mascara ingredients, and anyone wanting to reduce daily makeup application time. The treatment is particularly beneficial for special events, vacations, or those seeking long-term lash enhancement without daily maintenance.",

  contraindications: "Certain conditions may contraindicate eyelash extension application or require special considerations. These include active eye infections, severe allergies to adhesive components, extremely weak or damaged natural lashes, certain eye conditions affecting lash growth, pregnancy for some adhesive formulations, and unrealistic expectations about maintenance requirements. A patch test may be recommended for individuals with sensitive skin or known allergies.",

  preparationAndAftercare: "Pre-treatment preparation includes arriving with clean, makeup-free eyes and avoiding oil-based eye products for several days prior. Post-application care involves keeping extensions dry for the first 24-48 hours, avoiding oil-based products around the eye area, gentle daily brushing with a clean spoolie, and sleeping on the back when possible. Regular maintenance appointments help preserve the appearance and health of both extensions and natural lashes.",

  expectedResults: "Clients can expect immediate enhancement in lash length, volume, and curl that lasts throughout the natural lash growth cycle. Extensions typically maintain their optimal appearance for 2-3 weeks before requiring maintenance fills. With proper care and regular maintenance, eyelash extensions provide consistent enhancement that eliminates the need for daily mascara application while maintaining a natural, flattering appearance.",

  safetyConsiderations: "Eyelash extension application maintains high safety standards when performed by trained professionals using quality products and proper techniques. Potential risks include allergic reactions to adhesive, eye irritation, natural lash damage from improper application or removal, and infection from unsanitary conditions. These risks are minimized through proper training, quality products, sanitary practices, and adherence to safety protocols.",

  historyAndDevelopment: "The modern technique of eyelash extensions originated in Japan and South Korea in the early 2000s, evolving from traditional false eyelash application methods. The practice gained international recognition around 2003-2004 when Japanese beauty innovators developed individual lash application techniques using medical-grade adhesives. The method spread to Western countries by 2005, with significant improvements in adhesive formulations and application tools. Synthetic fiber technology advanced throughout the 2010s, introducing silk-like and mink-like materials that provided more natural appearance and comfort. Recent innovations include volume lashing techniques, hybrid methods, and improved adhesive formulations that extend retention and reduce sensitivity reactions.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How long do eyelash extensions typically last?",
      answer: "Eyelash extensions follow your natural lash growth cycle and typically last 4-6 weeks with proper care. Most clients schedule fill appointments every 2-3 weeks to maintain optimal fullness as natural lashes shed and new ones grow."
    },
    {
      question: "Will eyelash extensions damage my natural lashes?",
      answer: "When applied correctly by a certified professional using appropriate techniques and quality adhesive, eyelash extensions will not damage natural lashes. Proper isolation and application methods are essential to prevent stress on natural lash follicles."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I wear makeup and use skincare products with eyelash extensions?",
      answer: "Yes, but avoid oil-based products around the eye area as they can break down the adhesive. Water-based mascara can be applied to the tips if desired, though most clients find it unnecessary. Use gentle, oil-free cleansers and avoid rubbing the eye area."
    },
    {
      question: "What aftercare is required for eyelash extensions?",
      answer: "Keep extensions dry for 24-48 hours after application, avoid oil-based products, gently brush with a clean spoolie daily, sleep on your back when possible, and avoid rubbing or pulling on the extensions. Regular fill appointments help maintain the best appearance."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between classic, volume, and hybrid lash techniques?",
      answer: "Classic lashes involve applying one extension per natural lash for natural enhancement. Volume uses multiple ultra-fine extensions per natural lash for fuller, more dramatic results. Hybrid combines both techniques for varied texture and natural-looking fullness."
    },
    {
      question: "Are eyelash extensions suitable for everyone?",
      answer: "Most people can wear eyelash extensions, but those with very weak or damaged natural lashes, certain eye conditions, or allergies to adhesive components may need to avoid them. A consultation and possible patch test can determine suitability."
