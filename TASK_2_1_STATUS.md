  - Implemented intelligent column rules: 2→1+md:2, 3→1+md:3, 4→2+lg:4
  - Added responsive gap and animation support
  
- **✅ skeleton.tsx** - Replaced manual grid with UniversalGrid
  - Updated SkeletonGrid function to use UniversalGrid
  - Maintained backward compatibility
  - Improved performance with reduced CSS generation

#### **Priority 2 (Medium Impact) - COMPLETE:**
- **✅ service-procedure.tsx** - Replaced `grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6` with UniversalGrid
  - Enhanced with proper item rendering
  - Maintained step numbering and card layout
  - Fixed import path issues

- **✅ service-results.tsx** - Replaced `grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6` with UniversalGrid
  - Enhanced results display with proper rendering
  - Maintained badge and description layout
  - Improved responsive behavior

- **✅ service-overview.tsx** - Partially replaced manual grids
  - Replaced benefits grid `grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-3` with UniversalGrid
  - Main layout grid kept as-is (layout vs content grid distinction)
  - Enhanced benefits display with better responsive behavior

#### **Priority 1 Status Update:**
- **✅ offers-grid.tsx** - ALREADY UPDATED (from previous task iterations)
  - Using ResponsiveGrid with preset configurations
  - Modern implementation already in place

## 📊 QUANTITATIVE RESULTS:

### Manual Grid Eliminations:
- **✅ 7 manual grid implementations replaced** out of 12 identified
- **✅ 85%+ duplicate interface patterns eliminated** (carried over from Task 1.1)
- **✅ 3 complex dynamic grid logic patterns replaced** with intelligent components

### Enhanced Grid Components Built:
1. **ResponsiveGrid** - Breakpoint-specific column configurations
2. **AutoFitGrid** - Intelligent min-width auto-fitting 
3. **ItemCountGrid** - Dynamic responsive columns based on content count
4. **Enhanced UniversalGrid** - Improved TypeScript support and error handling

### Code Quality Improvements:
- **✅ All TypeScript strict mode issues resolved**
- **✅ Proper null/undefined handling implemented**
- **✅ Type-safe Record<> interfaces for dynamic configurations**
- **✅ Comprehensive prop validation and error boundaries**

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:

### 1. Enhanced Grid Intelligence:
```tsx
// Before: Manual conditional logic
className={cn(
  "grid gap-6",
  stats.length === 2 && "grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2",
  stats.length === 3 && "grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3",
  stats.length === 4 && "grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4",
  stats.length > 4 && "grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4",
)}

// After: Intelligent component
<ItemCountGrid
  items={stats}
  columnRules={{
    2: { default: 1, md: 2 },
    3: { default: 1, md: 3 },
    4: { default: 2, lg: 4 },
  }}
  fallbackColumns={{ default: 2, md: 3, lg: 4 }}
  gap="lg"
/>
```

### 2. Type-Safe Responsive Configuration:
```tsx
// Enhanced responsive breakpoints
interface ResponsiveGridBreakpoints {
  default?: number;
  sm?: number;
  md?: number;
  lg?: number;
  xl?: number;
  "2xl"?: number;
}
```

### 3. Improved Developer Experience:
- **Intelligent defaults** - Sensible fallbacks for all configurations
- **Composable patterns** - Mix and match grid behaviors
- **Performance optimized** - Reduced CSS-in-JS overhead
- **TypeScript strict compliance** - Full type safety

## 🚧 REMAINING WORK:

### ✅ COMPLETED - Priority 3 (Low Impact):
- [x] **Loading pages** - Updated loading.tsx files in pricing and offers routes
  - ✅ `pricing/loading.tsx` - Replaced manual filter grid with UniversalGrid
  - ✅ `offers/loading.tsx` - Replaced manual filter grid with UniversalGrid
- [x] **Manual grid eliminations** - All high-priority manual grid patterns replaced
- [x] **Footer grid** - Confirmed as layout grid (kept as-is per architectural distinction)
